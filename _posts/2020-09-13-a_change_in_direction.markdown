My name is Amanda, I am 26 years old and currently reside in Austin, TX. I received my masters degree in communication sciences and disorders in 2018 and have been working as a medical speech language pathologist ever since. As a speech language pathologist, I spend my days diagnosing and treating individuals suffering from communication and/or swallowing disorders. I have the opportunity to be part of the recovery process for many individuals, playing a large part in enabling them to speak and to be understood, to understand others, or to simply share a meal with a loved one. It is a very rewarding job, one that I am grateful to be qualified to do. 

So why change? 

While there are so many things that I love about being a speech therapist, it often feels as if there is a limit to how much I can really do. In healthcare, there are many obstacles involved in getting people the care they need, when and where they need it. As a speech therapist, I am often left feeling like there is more that could be done, and more individuals who need help that aren't getting it. It brings a lot of frustration and casts a dark shadow over a once very rosy picture. When the COVID pandemic hit, these challenges only became worse. I realized it was time to make a change. 

Why software engineering? 

Looking on a forum designed to help speech language pathologists reconcile and move past the frustrations I mentioned above, I came across a company developing an application to assist people with communication disorders. The more I looked into this company, the more excited I became, and the more I wanted the be able to be part of something like it. This was ultimately the turning point for me in making my decision. I realized that by learning to actually build a product like that, I could use the my problem solving skills, my desire to help others, and my unique perspective to create products that can help others, and that could reach more people than and single therapist ever could. After careful though, I decided to enroll in the Flatiron School's software engineering program. I am excited to start this journey and see where it will take me.

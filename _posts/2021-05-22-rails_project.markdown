For my Rails project, I created an application for pet owners to find and connect with pet sitters in their area to schedule jobs. I hit the ground running with planning out the many features I wanted to include and the various relationships I would need to make them happen. After narrowing down my planning to a reasonable amount of features, I was ready to start. Immediately, I was hit with problem after problem. My entire app idea revolved around have two different types of users, each with their own individual (and different) interactions with the application and with interactions with each other. This made my relationships tricky and at the time, seemingly impossible to generate. After much thought, research, and ultimately seeking guidance from a more experienced developer, I ended up finding a solution that would allow me to create my tables, models, and associations while fitting my application needs. I had my first problem solved and was ready to start building. 

Naturally, as I dove back in I continued to hit problem after problem. I was starting to get overwhelmed. The more overwhelmed I became, the less effective I was at finding appropriate solutions. This concept of being less effective when more stressed is not a new one. It makes total sense, when you are not the one who is stressed out. It took me a bit of time, and a lot of frustration, before I finally could see that the main issue in solving these problems was my own desperation to solve the problems. I decided to step away from my project for a day and to reset my brain as it was beginning to feel fried. I had been working nonstop up to this point and I had a growing list of todo items that needed my attention. After not actively thinking about my code for an entire day, I woke up the next morning and had a lightbulb go off and I knew exactly how to solve my first problem. From there, I was able to get back into the groove of coding and work through my code calmly and effectively. 

My main takeaway from this project is that sometimes the best thing to do is to step away and come back to a problem later. This may seem counter-productive, but for someone like me, it can save a lot of time and frustration along the way. Further developing this skill and learning to better recognize when a break is needed will help me be more successful in the workplace and improve my ability to succeed in this profession overall.

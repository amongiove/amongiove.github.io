For my second project, I decided to create an application where users could create and maintain book lists, find new books, interact with other users, and rate/review books they have read. This being my first Sinatra project, and only my second project overall, I was rightfully intimidated to start building this application from scratch. I tried to ease into it by using what I had learned from my first project to start the planning process. For my CLI project, one of my main takeaways was that I didn’t plan as effectively as I should have. The tickets I tried to create didn’t have specified acceptance goals and were too large in scope. I often ended up deviating from the ticket all together. Ultimately, without the proper planning, completing the CLI project was much more challenging and a bit messy. 

I really wanted to work through this assignment as if I were completing it in a professional work environment. I decided to use Jira to organize and create tickets for each piece of functionality and the different features I wanted to add. This ended up being the best thing I could have done. It allowed me to really think through each step and each line of code I would be writing. The tickets kept me organized and made sure I wasn’t jumping around too much. Following the pattern of creating my tickets and completing one small ticket at a time prevented me from getting overwhelmed when I got stuck and allowed me to problem solve more effectively. 

This project challenged me to use all the knowledge I have gained through the course so far, as well as to research and utilize new frameworks and tools. Overall, I am very pleased with how my application turned out. Comparing my first project to this one, the increase in personal skill and application functionality is apparent. Does it stand up the the professional applications we use every day? Not really. But I don’t think that is the point of these assignments. I am still very new at coding and I am continuing to learn more every day. This project is far from perfect. There is a lot that can be improved upon, and in the future, I hope to make those improvements. For now, I am happy with my work. Completing this project gave me chance to showcase everything I have learned thus far, while also highlighting how much more I have to learn. I am excited to see what the next portion of this course will add to my skill set.

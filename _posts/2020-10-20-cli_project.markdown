I have finally completed my Command Line Interface (CLI) project. From start to finish, this project has challenged me, frustrated me, and forced me to push my boundaries and solidified all the skills I have been learning for the past few weeks. It is a totally different experience creating an application from scratch compared to completing the read-alongs and coding labs from the learn curriculum. I feel very accomplished to have successfully completed this project. 

I learned a ton from creating this project. While I did learn a lot about coding with Ruby, APIs, and other applicable programming tools, I feel that the most important takeaway had nothing to do with the actual code. The most important thing I learned was to take each problem one step at a time. I have a tendency to approach problems from a ‘big picture’ perspective. I like to attack problems from every direction at once and trust that it will all fit together in the end. In the creation of my CLI, through many attempts and failures, I found that this was not going to work. In the world of programming, we need to approach our programs one step at a time. Having to slow down and just code and test one piece completely before moving on to the next really challenged me. It forced me to really think about what I was doing, each step of the way. I would be lying if I didn’t say that this also caused a lot of anxiety. Being stuck on one problem for hours can be scary. When faced with one of these more difficult problems, my brain automatically wanted to just skip it and jump ahead to code whatever I could. It wasn’t easy, but forcing myself to slow down ultimately made this project easier and allowed all the pieces to work together as seamlessly as possible. 

I am so happy with how my project turned out. I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, or if I could even complete something like this on my own. This experience really allowed me to push my boundaries and to gain confidence in both my decision to do to this and in my ability to do this successfully. I am excited to see what I can learn from the next section.
